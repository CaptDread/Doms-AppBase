This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Aswell as the Capacitor framework for mobile app development.

## Description

In my time as a developer I came to realize I never actually made a Todo List style project. Not once, in all my years of Javascript, php, c#, or lua. Never. Despite the fact that I was constantly making todo list and checklists in my notes and in paper. As Dom's app is my first steps into mobile app development (Capacitor makes it as easy as web development), I figured hey, why not make myself a clean productivity app to carry around in my very own pocket.

## Goals

When it comes to this app there are a number of things I specificly want. All of which are simple, and come with their own laundry list of frameworks to choose from. Capacitor is helping to achieve one of those goals, converting my dynamic Next.js site into a static site prime for mobile applications. Nonetheless, my complete goals are as follows.

> I want the application as mobile as possible, for quick and easy access. No entering a website url into my favorite personal web browser.
> I want record keeping and task tracking. Idk why but being able to see my stats for things triggers dopamine in my grey matters. 
> Sub-Tasks, ie Tasks that consist of multiple smaller task to achieve, before being able to complete it.
> Lastly, I'd like the UI to be simple yet consist of shortcuts for quicker use.

The overall goal isn't to make another generic run of the mill todo list for the app store, it is to create a beneficial tool. If this app surpasses my expectations, then I'll gladdly add it to the app store. 

If you took the time to read this, thank you for your time.
